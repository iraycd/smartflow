<h3>What does SmartFlow.JS do?</h3>
<p>Ideally, the most legible typography contains <a href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/" target="_blank">between 45 and 75 characters per line</a>. This is difficult to accomplish for <em>all</em> screen widths with only CSS media-queries. SmartFlow.JS eases this difficulty by changing the font-size <del>and subsequently the line-height</del> based on a specific element's width. This allows for a perfect character count per line at <em>any</em> screen width.</p>
<p>Additional options, <a href="#options">reviewed below</a>, allow you to configure SmartFlow.JS to fit your needs. These options include element size thresholds, font-size thresholds and ratios. The element size thresholds will stop SmartFlow.JS from performing its magic once the element reaches beyond specific pixel dimensions. The font-size thresholds will stop SmartFlow.JS from resizing the text beyond certain font-sizes. Lastly, you have full control over the base font-size, so that you can set your typography perfectly.</p>
<p>SmartFlow.JS is extremely easy to use. Visit the <a href="#getting-started">getting started</a> section, follow the four easy steps and you will be on well on your way to performing magic.</p>
